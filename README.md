# FLOW.VisualSearch

uses the visualsearch JS by documentcloud to do an advanced search in your model objects

* http://documentcloud.github.io/visualsearch/ 
* https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch

Basicly it ships a FLUID ViewHelper and the ability to configure that viewHelper heavily, this way we can do advanced searches

You can define:

* and configure multiple Searches
* search multiple attributes of a model (uses dynamic query building)
* Repositories have to implement an interface to be searchable
